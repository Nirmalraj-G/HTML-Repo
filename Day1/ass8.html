            A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic. <br>
            Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.<br>
            A paragraph usually deals with a single idea.<br>In general, you'll have an introductory sentence expressing that idea,
             and several supporting sentences to round it off. <br>Paragraphs are usually about 100 – 200 words long, 
            but there are more exceptions to this rule-of-thumb than you'd expect
